This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error stems from an incorrect loop condition in the `for` loop, which attempts to access an element beyond the array's valid index range.  This is a classic example of a subtle but impactful programming mistake.
